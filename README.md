# Sensor Calibrator

Sensor Calibrator is a regression system that brings the measured value on the sensor closer to the calibrator value. In this study, the calibrator used was the thermogun. The results of this study are how robust the system using deep learning is compared to ordinary linear regression and how many error values are generated by the regression system using deep learning.

The following graph shows the value of DHT11 using deep learning and linear regression after validating using StratifiedShuffleSplit and K-Fold.
